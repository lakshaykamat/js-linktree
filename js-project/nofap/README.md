## What is No fap

[No fap](NoFap.com) is a website and organization that calls itself a “comprehensive community-based porn recovery site.”

The organization challenges users to abstain from pornography, masturbation, or sex altogether in order to “reboot” the brain to heal so-called “porn addiction“ and associated sexual dysfunction. This is supposed to lead to numerous benefits, including improved relationships and fulfillment.

NoFap offers members support in the way of a community forum and reboot challenges and events. Members also get access to videos, blog posts, and podcasts. They also offer apps to help members track their days of abstinence and stay motivated

### Where did NoFap originate?

NoFap started on Reddit in 2011 during an online convo between folks who’d given up masturbation.

The term “NoFap“ (now a trademarked name and business) came from the word “fap,” which is internet lingo for the sound of masturbating. You know — fapfapfapfap.

What started as a casual discussion is now a website and organization that promotes quitting not just masturbation, but also quitting engaging with porn and other sexual behaviors.

The target audience appears to predominantly be straight cisgender men, with smaller pockets of cisgender women and LGBTQIA+ folks.

Proponents say that adopting the NoFap lifestyle offers a range of benefits, from mental clarity to muscle growth. But is there any truth behind these claims?

### What are the purported benefits of NoFap?

Most of the purported benefits are attributed to a supposed increase in testosterone levels, a concept that fueled the original Reddit discussion back in the day.

One of the forum users shared a small 2003 studyTrusted Source that found that not ejaculating for 7 days raised testosterone levels, leading others to go a week without masturbating.

Those who abstained went on to share other potential benefits of “fapstinence.” This included mental and physical health benefits, as well as spiritual awakenings and epiphanies.
