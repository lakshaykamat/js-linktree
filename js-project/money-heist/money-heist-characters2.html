        <div class="lg:mx-32 mx-3">
            <p class="leading-9 md:leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">We first meet Mónica Gaztambide as a put-upon
                underling
                working at the Spanish Mint. She is Arturo's mistress, and when he finds out she's pregnant, he ends
                things with her. Then, they get taken over by The Professor's crew, and Arturo pressures the hostages to
                help him be a hero. Mónica does so, and Berlin tells Denver to kill her, but he can't do it. Instead,
                Denver shoots her in the leg so that Berlin thinks he's done the deed, and then he rehabs her. Slowly,
                they fall in love, though people say it's because she has "Stockholm syndrome," which is the eventual
                codename she takes.

                Eventually, Mónica chooses to be with Denver, and she becomes part of the crew by the end of the 2nd
                season after picking up a gun to help the crew escape. When round two begins, she immediately jumps into
                the mix, but she doesn't have the mental toughness of the former robbers. She's scared, in part for her
                child. After Arturo tries to kill Denver and the rest of the crew, she shoots him, which should be a
                moment of triumph over the man who had belittled her. Instead, she feels like she jeopardized her backup
                plan: having Arturo raise their biological child. Season 5 ends with her messed up on drugs she's taken
                to numb herself, rendering her useless during the crew's biggest firefight of the whole series.

            <p class="leading-9 md:leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">Anibal Cortes is the baby of the heist crew.
                He's constantly seen as the weakest link, both in the first heist when the authorities get his parents
                to plead with him and in the second when he proves as much. In particular, when Gandia escapes, Rio has
                a chance to shoot him but can't bring himself to do so. Anybody else in the group would've taken the
                supercop out, and Gandia's escape ultimately leads to Nairobi's death, putting blood on Rio's hands.

                Rio is also one of Tokyo's main weaknesses — she cares about him, and that leads her to make decisions
                that jeopardize the rest of the crew. He freaks out when she is given up in the first heist but is
                easily overpowered. And while he seems nice enough and has lots of tech knowledge, he can be kind of
                boring. Plus, Rio is a bit more of a passive actor than an active one. More specifically, he joined the
                heist because he didn't have many other options, and in the second plot, he's revealed to be even less
                tough after his time in captivity. It'll be interesting to see if he steps up now that Tokyo is gone,
                but so far, he's still the weakest link.

        <img src="Images/palermo.webp" class="w-auto m-auto h-auto img-animate my-2" alt="">
        <div class="lg:mx-32 mx-3">
            <p class="leading-9 md:leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">It's interesting how many characters from the
                second heist are so much worse than the people from the first time around. Palermo is one such person,
                and the irony is that he helped plan the Bank of Spain heist with his best friend, Berlin. He also was
                in love with Berlin — an unrequited love, since Berlin was heterosexual, as far as we know. Indeed,
                Palermo all but wants to kill himself after Berlin's death, but The Professor takes him on to act in a
                similar role as his old friend. The thing is, while Berlin (despite his horrible character) was always
                calm and in control, Palermo is more of a wildcard with a tendency to get petty and indignant.

                Palermo helps inspire Gandia to escape. He acts impulsively, and just like Gandia, he talks down to
                Nairobi (partly because of his own misogyny). Eventually, he comes back into the fold and is from then
                on a selfless, contributing (if not a little bit humbled) member of the team. But since his betrayal
                over petty bickering leads to Nairobi's death, he can never be fully redeemed. Still, his rescue of and
                admission of feelings for Helsinki are a step in the right direction.

    <!--Alicia Sierra-->

            <p class="leading-9 md:leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">
                Alicia Sierra is the bad guy in heist two until she's not. She walks in with so much self-aggrandizement
                and ego you can't help but hate her from the first moment you lay eyes on her. Even before she begins
                negotiating with The Professor, we see her torturing poor Rio, reducing him to a shred of the human he
                was (and that former man wasn't very tough anyway). She loves to think of herself as the smartest,
                coolest person in the room, and when The Professor bests her, she appears to be in disbelief. She's much
                different from Raquel Murrillo in the first heist, who celebrated even her small victories with
                humility.

                Sierra's ego is only overshadowed by her faith in the system of which she is a part, which is why she's
                absolutely shocked when Tamayo destroys her to save himself. She then captures The Professor, and you
                think your hatred of Sierra couldn't get any greater. Then she has her baby, basically by herself, on
                the floor of a criminal mastermind's hideout. That's toughness, and the whole experience seems to humble
                her. Hopefully, she'll hold onto that and realize that (in "Money Heist" at least) the criminals are the
                good guys.

    <!-- Berlin -->
    <div class="sm:m-12">
        <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl lg:text-3xl m-2">12. Berlin</h2>
        <img src="Images/berlin.webp" class="w-auto m-auto h-auto img-animate my-2" alt="">
        <div class="lg:mx-32 mx-3">
            <p class="leading-9 md:leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">
                Berlin is a very polarizing character, and some would say he should be nearer to the top of the list.
                After all, he was the brother of The Professor, a part-planner of both heists, and a great conman long
                before they went to the Royal Mint in Season 1. The flashback scenes during the second heist show him
                inspiring those around them (including his son) to criminal greatness and depict a dynamic, suave man —
                a Spanish Danny Ocean with a million-dollar smile. So you almost forget who he actually was, at least in
                Seasons 1 and 2.

                Remember: Berlin played mind games with everybody, both on his team and the other side. Quite often, he
                seemed to get some sadistic joy out of his torments. When he takes a hostage as his concubine, he
                crosses the line into, well, rape. Let's not forget that. Sure, he ends the season with a last stand to
                let the rest escape, but he knows he'll be dead in six months anyway, so it's really not that bad a way
                to go out; certainly not as noble as Tokyo's eventual self-sacrifice.

                So yes, Berlin was aspirational, inspiring, and seemed like he was probably a really fun guy in his
                early years. And he certainly loved his little brother. But by the time we see him in the Mint heist,
                he's a dictatorial sadist who lives for physical, sexual, and psychological power games.

                Colonel Luis Tamayo is the new chief of operations in the second heist (Seasons 3 through 5) and is
                the perfect example of why people find themselves rooting for thieves over their own government and
                police. Indeed, Tamayo lies and cheats at every turn. After having tasked Alicia Sierra with using
                any means necessary to get information out of Rio, he quickly disavows her when the truth comes to
                light.

                Tamayo is willing to suffer civilian casualties to take down The Professor's team. In fact, he's
                even caught on tape saying it'll gain him public sympathy if he can pin a hostage death on the
                abductors. Of course, he proves just how self-serving he is when he throws Alicia Sierra under the
                bus, essentially turning her into an international criminal by claiming she worked with The
                Professor after she tells the world that everything she'd done was under his command. Ready to
                betray enemy and "friend" alike, Tamayo is a ruthless, self-serving autocrat hungry to prove he
                deserves the hot seat

                Gandia and Arturo would make a dream team of men hungry to take down "bad guys" not because they
                want to help others but because they want to be labeled heroes. In Seasons 1 and 2, Arturo tries to
                rally the hostages against the heisters despite the fact that there is no physical danger to them.
                Every one of his plots involves somebody else taking the big risk while he's ready to claim victory.
                Then there's Mónica Gaztambide, his mistress. When Arturo finds out she's pregnant with his child,
                he says it will hurt his family and rejects her. But when she falls for Denver, he tries to get her
                back. Helsinki labels the man "Arturito" ("little Arturo") because he's a little boy playing a big
                boy game.

                In Season 3, Arturo is giving big speeches as the hero who led the revolt against the thieves in the
                first heist. When he sees the second heist going down, he runs in because he lives for the adulation
                he has created around his own mythology. There, he again tries to rally people against their
                captors, eventually arming up for the apparent purpose of killing Denver and taking back what's
                "his." Which leads Mónica, now code-named "Stockholm," to shoot him herself. He's a petty,
                egocentric man happy to justify his own desire for revenge and adoration with a quest to save the
                day.
