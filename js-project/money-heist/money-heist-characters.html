             <p class="leading-9 md:leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">Immortalised by Alvaro Morte, ‘The Professor’
                 is the chief architect behind the various nerve-wracking action sequences in the show. Money Heist would
                 not have been the same had this mastermind not been there. He turns a group of simple rogues into a
                 delectable unit who, despite their crimes of looting the Bank of Spain, manage to secure the best spot
                 in the hearts of the audience who root for them. A master of manipulation and deceit, he is the main
                 driving force who operates from the wings. Intelligent, meticulous and ambitious, the Professor is well
                 versed in almost everything, including politics, negotiations, heists, psychology and more. He is calm
                 and possesses innate leadership qualities. He has the ability to infuse motivation into this team at
                 their lowest. When asked what he liked about his character, Morte said, “I like many things about The
                 Professor but mainly his patience and capacity to work. He’s an intelligent guy. He’s spent years just
                 working on a plan”. He was also awestruck by how the Professor never waited for “inspiration” to make
                 things work. According to Morte, the Professor’s immense “hard work” is what makes him so very likeable.
                 We totally agree!</p>

             <p class="leading-9 md:leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">Smart, volatile and unpredictable, Tokyo is
                 the
                 first character the audience is introduced to and serves as the ubiquitous narrator of the show. With a
                 tempestuous temperament, Tokyo is spirited, reckless and wild. Undeniably brave, Tokyo has had her fair
                 share of questionable moments on the show and often annoyed the audience with her impulsive nature. She
                 has
                 a complicated relationship with Rio and a wonderful bond with Nairobi. With a tragic past, Tokyo is
                 fiercely
                 protective and very caring.
                 . Played by Ursula Corbero, the character is given a different dimension by the actress who humanises
                 her.
                 The Professor’s absolute favourite, despite her stubbornness, Tokyo is a pivotal character in the show.
                 Tokyo’s death was one of the boldest moves by the showrunners who killed off the most popular character
                 on
                 the show. She sacrificed herself to save the team and to prevent the Army from taking over the Bank of
                 Spain. </p>

             <p class="leading-9 md:leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">Alex Pina has initially not written Nairobi’s
                 character. Including her to make the gang more balanced was perhaps one of his best decisions as Nairobi
                 turned out to be an absolute fan favourite. Nairobi is an expert at forging and counterfeiting. With a
                 tragic backstory, where she lost the custody of her son due to her prison time, she is a true leader who
                 never backs down from challenging the patriarchal dominance in the team. She is sympathetic and bold as
                 well
                 as extremely lively and intriguing, making her one of the most well-rounded characters on the show.
                 Agata
                 Jimenez’s Nairobi went on to become one of the most beloved and amicable characters on the show whose
                 death
                 was a central cause of conflict in the show as well as among fans who were shocked to see their
                 favourite
                 character being killed in cold blood. The Professor and his gang wanted to honour her and seek
                 vengeance,
                 regrouping by chanting “For Nairobi” in the finale. She is the symbol of undefeated matriarchy in the
                 film
                 and someone we miss dearly!</p>

         <div class="lg:mx-32 mx-3">
             <p class="leading-9 md:leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">Although Pedro Alonso’s Berlin was a pretty
                 complicated, cold and calculative character, in the beginning, he was the Professor’s brother-in-arms
                 and
                 second-in-command. With sharp observational skills, Berlin shields the chaos in his heart with a stoic
                 demeanour. Alonso had reportedly derived inspiration for this character from a previous interaction with
                 a
                 person who was a slightly manipulative provocateur. Although the Professor and Berlin were not
                 originally
                 supposed to have such a close bond, the actors insisted on it and that worked in the favour of the
                 series.
                 Alonso’s brilliant portrayal of this arrogant yet suave and enigmatic character even won him the ‘Best
                 Supporting Television Actor’ award in 2018. While audience members generally loathed Berlin in the
                 beginning
                 due to his difficult and nonchalant demeanour, his selflessness in the face of death left them in tears.
                 In
                 the second season, the terminally ill Berlin sacrifices himself to help the rest of the gang escape
                 unhurt
                 while he receives the brunt of the police fire.

         <div class="lg:mx-32 mx-3">
             <p class="leading-9 md:leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">Jaime Lorente’s Denver is one of the most
                 endearing
                 characters on the show. He is born into a life of crime and joins his father on this heist to escape a
                 low-paying mining job. Although he is temperamental in the beginning, he displays a human and
                 sympathetic
                 side when he defies Berlin’s orders to keep a hostage named Monica safe with whom he later falls in
                 love,
                 adding plenty of heartwarming romantic moments to the show. Goofy and lion-hearted, Denver, however, has
                 a
                 bizarre, signature laugh that was improvised by Lorente. According to Lorente, the actor had to work
                 hard to
                 develop this “trashy laugh” for the character. He first stumbled upon him while auditioning for the
                 show.
                 “From the very beginning, they wanted Denver to have a unique and significant laugh,” he said. “And what
                 happened is that I kept trying different ones, I found this one and we settled on it. And that was
                 probably
                 the main reason I was selected for this role.”</p>

             <p class="leading-9 md:leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">Lisbon began as the enemy. In the first heist,
                 she was
                 constantly trying to thwart The Professor, and she was smart enough to almost pull it off before he
                 started courting her to distract her. Then a strange thing happened — they fell in love. Her police
                 partner didn't like their relationship from the get-go, but since she finds Sergio Marquina (aka The
                 Professor) to be the more interesting and compassionate man, she chooses him.
 
                 After Raquel finds out who Sergio is, she's obviously hurt. But eventually, their mutual respect and
                 affection — combined with her growing hatred for the system she was supposed to be protecting — leads
                 her to run off and join him. In the second heist, she's part of the group under the name Lisbon, every
                 bit as hardcore and awesome as they are but also armed with greater intelligence about the other side
                 and working as The Professor's partner in brains and love. Even Tokyo, who obviously hates former
                 authority figures who interrogated her, eventually warms up to Lisbon. She would be higher on the list
                 if we didn't dislike her so much during the first heist for trying to trap The Professor and his crew.

             <p class="leading-9 md:leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">Mirko Dragic In the first heist, Helsinki is
                 the hired
                 muscle along with his brother (by experience, not blood — they're really cousins) Oslo. At first a
                 stone-faced golem, Helsinki shows himself to be eternally loyal, strong, and a good person, which makes
                 him the member we most want to know. And the scene when he has to "kill" the braindead Oslo may be the
                 first time you cry watching the series.
 
                 After the first heist, Helsinki is partnered up with Nairobi, and they have a ton of fun as lost people
                 partying and playing a married couple. She develops a love for him despite the fact that he's gay, and
                 while he doesn't return the romantic feeling, she becomes family. While they plan round two, he falls in
                 with Palermo, who doesn't reciprocate his mental affections, though he's all about the physical.
                 Eventually, Helsinki breaks through his iron shell.
 
                 The first to take up whatever tough job needs to be done, Helsinki is the member of the crew with the
                 purest heart and the most courage. His love of Nairobi inspires all of us to care for those closest to
                 us, and he even inspires Palermo to finally care about somebody for the first time since Berlin.</p>
